1. Clone the GitHub repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/qubist/holobot.git

```
$ go get github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/model
```

```
$ make run
```
You can verify the Bot is running when
  - `Server detected and is running version 3.X.X` appears on the command line.
  - `Mattermost Bot Sample has started running` is posted in the `Debugging For Sample Bot` channel.

### Testing the Bot

2. Join the `Debugging For Sample Bot` channel.
